# Go in React, Redux and Elm

The starting point for this project was a tutorial by Chris LaRose:

http://cjlarose.com/2014/01/09/react-board-game-tutorial.html

## Summary

Here I implement the board game go three times.

* First using facebook's [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/) by itself - [tag](https://github.com/ajhyndman/go-react-redux-elm/releases/tag/Vanilla-React)
* Second adding in [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) - [tag](https://github.com/ajhyndman/go-react-redux-elm/releases/tag/React-Redux)
* Third using only [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) - [tag](https://github.com/ajhyndman/go-react-redux-elm/releases/tag/Elm)

The initial Vanilla React app is a direct implementation of Chris LaRose's tutorial above.  The React-Redux and Elm versions are my take, and meant to be exact replicas of one another.
