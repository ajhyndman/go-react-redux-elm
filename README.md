# Go in React, Redux and Elm

The starting point for this project was a tutorial by Chris LaRose:

## Summary

Here I implement the board game go three times.

* First using facebook's [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/) by itself - [tag](https://github.com/ajhyndman/go-react-redux-elm/releases/tag/Vanilla-React)
* Second adding in [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) - [tag](https://github.com/ajhyndman/go-react-redux-elm/releases/tag/React-Redux)
* Third using only [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) - (uncompleted)

Each of these implementations is a complete re-write.  Each implementation was created in succession.  As I learned, or acquired new ideas, I incorporated them into new versions, without backporting.
